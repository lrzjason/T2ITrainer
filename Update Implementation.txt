Multiple Subdir configs
	image could use random reference from the same subdir
	different sub dir could have individual config
Noise Adjustment (Immiscible-Diffusion Varient)
LayerSync (weak layer sync strong layer, cos sim)

embedding needs to create mutiple refs in same subdir and this refs order needs to be stored
use the same order to arrange the ref latent list.
